# Create table

Let say you just want to quickly test and validate your query with a small set of data, or you want to write a set of data and use that with some other data tables. How do we do that?&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example 1" %}
```

datatable (Date: datetime, Event: string) [
    datetime(1910-06-11), "Born",
    datetime(1930-01-01), "Enters Ecole Navale",
    datetime(1953-01-01), "Published first book",
    datetime(1997-06-25), "Died"
]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

&#x20;
