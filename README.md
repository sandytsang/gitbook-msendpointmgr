# Learning KQL

In this chapter, we will show some examples that we use frequently to help you start using KQL

If you don't have any data that you can use, you can log in to **KQL Playground** [https://aka.ms/LAdemo](https://aka.ms/LAdemo) and use that in your practics.&#x20;

Where and how did I start to learn this? Here is our list of where you can begin.

## Workbook

Azure Monitor workbook provides rich visual reports in Azure Portal and gives you a real-time and interactive experience. In addition, workbooks can query data from multiple sources within Azure, and combine all these data from different sources into a single report.
