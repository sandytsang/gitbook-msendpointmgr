# Device OS version

## Using SigninLogs

You might ask a question here, why use **SigninLogs** table, not **IntuneDevices** table? Because IntuneDevices table only gives details of devices that are managed by Intune.&#x20;

Let's say you want to use Intune managed mobile devices, both MDM and MAM, we know Intune doesn't support all operating systems, there are some requirements, therefore your might need a list of devices' operating system version and users, so that maybe some of the lucky users will get a new phone:smile:.  &#x20;

See Intune supported operating system details on Microsoft Doc [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers)

### 1️⃣Example #1: Android OS versions

So how can we get a list of devices' operating system versions that users are using to access organization data?  Let's use **SigninLogs** to find out what iOS versions we have

```
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago (180d)
| extend OperatingSystem = tostring(DeviceDetail.operatingSystem)
| extend Browser = tostring(DeviceDetail.browser)
| where OperatingSystem contains "Android"
    and UserPrincipalName has '@'
    and UserAgent has "Android "
    and (AppDisplayName has "Office"
    or AppDisplayName == "Outlook Mobile")
| extend UserAgent = split(UserAgent, "; ")
| extend OSVersion = tostring(UserAgent[1])
| distinct UserPrincipalName, OSVersion, AppDisplayName, ClientAppUsed, Browser
```

### 2️⃣Example #2: Sign-in location details

This query tells you users' sign-in location details, IP address, Operating System

```
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago (180d)
| extend OperatingSystem = tostring(DeviceDetail.operatingSystem)
        , DeviceId = tostring(DeviceDetail.deviceId)
        , City = tostring(LocationDetails.city)
        , CountryOrRegion = tostring(LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
        , State = tostring(LocationDetails.state)
| distinct UserPrincipalName, DeviceId, OperatingSystem, IPAddress, City, CountryOrRegion, State
| project UserPrincipalName, DeviceId, OperatingSystem, IPAddress, CountryOrRegion, State, City
```
